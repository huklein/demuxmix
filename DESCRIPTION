Title: Demultiplexing hashtagged cells using regression mixture models
Version: 0.99.0
Date: 2021-08-30
Description: A package for demultiplexing single-cell sequencing experiments
    of pooled cells that were labelled with barcoded antibodies. The package
    provides methods to fit mixture models for a probabilistic classification
    of the cells and to assess the quality and error rates of the
    demultiplexing.
